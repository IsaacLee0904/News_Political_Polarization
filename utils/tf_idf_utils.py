    Filter out common words from a DataFrame based on a pre-trained TF-IDF vectorizer.
    
    This function operates in three main steps:
    1. Filters out words with a length less than 2 from the given column.
    2. Computes the TF-IDF scores for the filtered words using the provided vectorizer.
    3. Filters out the most common words based on the computed TF-IDF scores and the provided threshold.
    
    Parameters:
    - df: pandas DataFrame
        The input DataFrame containing the text data to be filtered.
    - column_name: str
        The column name in 'df' that contains the text data to be processed.
    - vectorizer: TfidfVectorizer object
        A pre-trained TF-IDF vectorizer for transforming the text data.
    - threshold: float, default=0.6
        Specifies the proportion of the least informative words to filter out based on their TF-IDF scores.
        For example, a threshold of 0.85 means that the bottom 85% of words, ranked by their TF-IDF scores, will be removed.
